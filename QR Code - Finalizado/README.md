## Overview

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

This is a really basic and simple project, so trying different ways of doing it's what i've aimed for.
Doing it all with only a HTML file and adding internal CSS is something to try.

### Continued development

For future projects introducing more Flex-box and Grid CSS into this type of webpages is something to look for,
making it easier to create and a great couple of skills to learn.
